# SodokuSolver
A Sodoku GUI built using Python's Tkinter library with a built in solver.

To use the program, simply run the main.py file. It will read in the contents of 'board.csv' and display its contents as the current board.

To use the solver, go to the solve menu at the top and select your desired solving method. The board will then be autopopulated with the solution.
